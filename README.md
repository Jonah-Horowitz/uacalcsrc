This git repository was initially created by importing Ralph Freese's uacalcsrc cvs repository from sourceforge using the following command:

    git cvsimport -C ~/git/uacalc -r cvs -k -vA authors-file.txt -d :pserver:anonymous@uacalc.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/uacalc uacalcsrc

(But first git-cvsimport had to be installed with `sudo apt-get install git-cvsimport`)

I will attempt to keep this git repo reasonably up-to-date with Ralph Freese's uacalcsrc Sourceforge repository by periodically running the command above and then doing:

   git push origin master

(But hopefully Ralph will eventually switch to git. :)
